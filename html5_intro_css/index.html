        <h3>Duelsense Edge controller</h3>
        <p>The DualSense Edge is Sony's first real take on a pro controller. 
            It has dabbled in attachments to add back buttons, sure, but this adds so much more. 
            The DualSense Edge, adds a pair of mappable back paddles, swappable joysticks with alternate cap options, adjustable triggers, a long braided cable, a carrying case and more.</p>

        <h3>Ps5 Headset:</h3>
        <p>The Sony Pulse 3D Wireless headset is the official headset of the PS5, so comes with Sony's solid reputation for good build quality, all at a reasonable $99/Â£89. 
                Add in compatibility with Sony's Tempest 3D Audio engine and you've got a rather impressive gaming headset.</p>

        <h3>Other Ps5 accessories:</h3>
        <p>The PS5 controller charger station features LED ambient light that indicates charge status behind a Marvel-style faceplate. 
            The dock also comes with a 39-inch USB-C charging cable, allowing the dock to be powered via console or wall charger, and theres a whole lot more for the platstation 5 to customize.</p>
